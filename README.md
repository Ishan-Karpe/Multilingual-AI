# Mutilingual AI Assistant with Gemini

## This is built using streamlit, very simple and clean, it detects your current time, and gives you a good morning/afternoon/evening message. Uses your microphone when you click 'Speak' and returns a tts response that you can download that plays alongside the generated text.
### I feel like this is one of the best projects that I've built so far
